# Dynamic To-Do List Application

A lightweight, responsive web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Built with vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation and data persistence using Local Storage.

## 🚀 Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new items to your list using the "Add Task" button or the Enter key.
* **Remove Tasks:** Delete completed or unwanted tasks with a single click.
* **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in your browser's **Local Storage**, so they remain available even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works across different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the web app.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling with flexbox for a modern look and feel.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Dynamic DOM manipulation and Local Storage API integration.
